* LdapReplay
A tool/library to assist in parsing LDAP server logs and replaying
LDAP transactions.

** Log Parsing
Currently the tool only parses OpenLDAP ldap.log-style logs. The
intent is for parsed logs to be stored in a generic internal data
structure which can then be written out to disk or traversed for
playback.

** Usage: 
: ruby -I./lib parseops3.rb ../ldap.log

** TODO:
   - create class to replay LDAP transactions

   - allow parameterized playback
     - allow scaling factor to speed up or slow down playback relative to recorded timing, or to play back as rapidly as possible
     - allow matching to constrain playback to only operations which match

   - add methods for querying parsed LDAP records for transactions/operations matching particular criteria
